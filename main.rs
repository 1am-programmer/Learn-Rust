/*
START A RUST PROGRAM
fn main ()
this is the beginning of any rust program
we declare the function using fn 

PRINT
println!("Hello, world!");
that is how to print in rust

VARAIBLES
Assigned with the "let" keyword
print! and println! are basically the same thing but the println! adds a new line

SCOPE OF A VARIABLE
is defined by the curly braces, ie the block of code in which it is declared

FUNCTIONS are reuseable blocks of code

SHADOWING allows a variabble to be redeclared with the same name in the same scope
